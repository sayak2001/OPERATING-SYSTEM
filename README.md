C program for shortest remaining time first scheduling algorithm.


If a new process arrives with CPU burst length less than remaining time of current executing process, preempt. This scheme is know as the Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF). If a new process arrives with a shorter burst time than remaining of current process then schedule new process. Further reduces average waiting time and average response time.
